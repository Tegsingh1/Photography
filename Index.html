            <h2> A Waterfall </h2>
            <p> A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below. ... Often, waterfalls
                form as streams flow from soft rock to hard rock. This happens both laterally (as a stream flows across the earth) and vertically (as the stream drops in a waterfall)</p>
